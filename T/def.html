The kernel concerpt of T is Template.Sure,we will see it in every where.<br>
To declare a Template,we must known how to write a variable:<br>
<br>
V[i] is a variable if it consists of Aa-Zz and _ .<br>
<br>
Then we continue to declare a Template:<br>
<br>
(@V[0],@V[1],...,@V[n])=>(E)<br>
<br>
So,what's the mean of @ before V[i] ?<br>
<br>
If @ is # then means V[i] must be calculated in real time when we need its values.<br>
If @ is no exsist then V[i] will be calculated in one time when it could be calculated.<br>
