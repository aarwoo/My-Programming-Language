The kernel concerpt of T is Template.<br>
So,I know you are hesisited to learn about how to declare a Template.<br>
But,We must get some concerpt before:<br>
E[i] is a expression.<br>
V[i] is a variable that consists of Aa-Zz or _ .<br>
Now we start to declare a Template:<br>
?(#V[1],#V[2],...,#V[n])=E[i];<br>
It's a Template which will receive n Expressions.<br>
V[i]'s value is the NO.i Expression received.<br>
<b>BUT WHAT!!!</b><br>
V[i] may not be calculated as soon as the NO.i Expression received unless ommit # before V[i] !!!<br>
Sure,We will have insteresting of # before V[i] .<br>
You could ask,what's this?Let me tell you!<br>
# before V[i] means V[i]'s value will be calculate whenever its value is need.<br>
