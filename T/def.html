The kernel concerpt of T is Template.Sure,we will see it in every where.
To declare a Template,we must known how to write a variable:
	V[i] is a variable if it consists of Aa-Zz and _ .
Then we continue to declare a Template:
	(@V[0],@V[1],...,@V[n]~)=>(E)
So,what's the mean of @ before V[i] ?
	If @ is # then means V[i] must be calculated in real time when we need its values.
	If @ is no exsist then V[i] will be calculated in one time when it could be calculated.
