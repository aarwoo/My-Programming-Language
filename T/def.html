The kernel concerpt of T is Template.<br>
So,I know you are hesisited to learn about how to declare a Template.<br>
But,We must get some concerpt before:<br>
E[i] is a expression.<br>
V[i] is a variable that consists of Aa-Zz or _ .<br>
Now we start to declare a Template:<br>
?(#V[1]~,#V[2]~,...,#V[n]~){E[0]}<br>
It's a Template that receives n group expressions.<br>
V[i] refers he NO.i group expressions received.<br>
Oka,I known you're insteresting in # and ~ .<br>
# before V[i] exsists means V[i] should be caluclated whenever need to known its value,or ommit
when we need calculate V[i] at once as soon as it could be calcuate.<br>
~ before V[i] exsists means NO.i groups expressions have at least 0 expressions which spilits by ; ,or ommit
when we require NO.i expressions must and only have one expression.<br>
ReMark:<br>
NO.j expression of V[i] is V[i]$j .<br>
The calculate way of V[i] is calculated V[i]$1,V[i]$2,V[i]$3,... one by one.<br>
