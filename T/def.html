<h5><b>The kernel concerpt of T is Template.</b></h5><br>
OK,you wants to known how to declare a Template,so you must known:
V and V[i] are a variable.<br>
E[i] is an expression.<br>
Declare a Template like this:<br>
(#V[1],#V[2],...,#V[n],#V~){E[0]}<br>
And we have some comment:<br>
It received at least n expressions.<br>
V[i] refers NO.i expressions it received.<br>
V refers all expressions it received after NO.n expressions it received.<br>
V(j) refers the NO.(n+1+j) expression it received.<br>
Then you would be pazz with # before V[i] or V .<br>
Aha,it's a soul of a Template.Without it, a Template is not a Template of T.<br>
# before V[i] or V means calculated V[i] and V whenever need.<br>
If we ommit # before V[i] or V then V[i] or V will be calculated when it could be calculated.<br>
How we calculate V ? V may has many expressions!<br>
So we def calculate V is calculate V(0),V(1),... one by one.<br>
